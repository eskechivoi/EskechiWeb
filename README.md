# Web page created with React.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In this project, you can find three different kinds of branches:
- main: The production code is maintained here.
- feature/...: Where I make changes or add new features to the web page.
- gh-pages: The web page, built and deployed to be shown in the browser.

Additionally, all the website information is parametrized and stored in several JSON files.
- `src/data/articles.json`: The articles' information, including the `.pdf` file that they must show.
- `src/data/projects.json`: The information about my projects.
- `src/data/skills.json`: The information about my curriculum.
